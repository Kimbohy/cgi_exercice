# Simple CGI Login System

This project demonstrates a basic CGI-based login system using C. The project consists of two main CGI programs, `index.cgi` for displaying the login form and handling error messages, and `traitement.cgi` for processing the login form submission and verifying the credentials.

## Project Structure

- `index.c` - Generates the login form and handles error messages when login fails.
- `traitement.c` - Processes the login form submission and checks the credentials against a stored database (`database.txt`).
- `style.css` - Provides the styling for the HTML generated by the CGI programs.
- `database.txt` - Stores the login credentials in the format `username,password`.
- `README.md` - This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How It Works

1. **index.cgi**: Displays a login form where users can enter their login and password. If the previous login attempt failed, an error message is shown.

2. **traitement.cgi**: Receives the POST data from `index.cgi`, extracts the login and password, and checks them against the entries in `database.txt`. If the credentials match, a success message is shown; otherwise, the user is redirected back to the login page with an error message.

3. **database.txt**: Contains the stored credentials in plain text, separated by a comma. Each line represents a different user.

## Compilation

To compile the CGI programs, use the following commands:

```sh
gcc -o index.cgi index.c
gcc -o traitement.cgi traitement.c
```
